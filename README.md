# Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor
Credit Card Approval Predictor Using Machine Learning Algorithm : <br>

In this project, we aim to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, similar to what real banks do. <br>
<br>
We’ll be working with the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. <br>
<br>
The dataset contains a mix of both numerical and non-numerical features, including anonymized attributes related to gender, age, debt, marital status, education level, ethnicity, employment history, credit score, and more. <br>
<br>
Our goal is to create a model that can predict whether an individual’s application for a credit card will be accepted or not. <br>
<br>
Why Predict Credit Card Approvals? <br>
<br>
Commercial banks receive numerous credit card applications daily.<br>
Manually analyzing these applications is time-consuming and error-prone.<br>
Machine learning models automate this process, making it efficient and accurate.<br>
